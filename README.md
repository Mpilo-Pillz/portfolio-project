# portfolio-project

Portfolio project showcasing TypeScript, React, Swift, iOS, Mongo and Express

## What did I do differently form the course project

- I am using TypeScript for the React Portion instead of JavaScript
- I used React Rouer v6 instead of v5 as on the course
- I used Vite React instead of Create-React-App
- I used React v18 instead of 17
