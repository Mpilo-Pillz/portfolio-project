Portfolio project showcasing TypeScript, React, Swift, iOS, Mongo and Express

# Web UI

Port http://127.0.0.1:5173/

## What did I do differently form the course project

- I am using TypeScript for the React Portion instead of JavaScript
- I used React Rouer v6 instead of v5 as on the course
- I used Vite React instead of Create-React-App
- I used React v18 instead of 17

## React Practices Displayed

- Use of Stateful and Presentational components
- Keeping Components Small and Focused on One Responsibility
- Opted to destructure props
- Use the empty fragment for a more modernised react
- for the aside decided to use React Portals to have it rendered as not a child of the root div
